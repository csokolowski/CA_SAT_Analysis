# Dissecting Californian SAT Test Results

## Problem Statement

**California is the largest state of the union. Can we predict what schools will perform better on the SATs from their stateâ€™s publicly accessed data collection?**

Data sources:

SAT (2019): https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sp/ai/ <br>
Expenses (2019): https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/ec/currentexpense.asp <br>
AP Testing (2019): https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sp/ai/ <br>

## Analysis

Counties' SAT results vary widely due to population size of counties among financial, cultural, and geographical reasons <br>
Positive correlation between SAT scores and AP classes <br>
Negative correlation between SAT scores and SAT participation <br>
Not enough data on school expenses to make an assertion <br>

## Data to consider

Comparing cities of similar population sizes would reduce data noise <br>
How will ACT benchmark scoring be affected by Californian schools removing standardized test scores?
